(Requires a vercel account, and vercel likes to spin down inactive servers so it may take a second to launch!)

## Why?
- Sometimes, pictures are a much better mode of communication than words, but pulling out a notebook and a camera or opening up MS Paint in order to show someone an idea over the internet can simply be far too cumbersome. Baordline solves this issue, by providing a fast and simple way to share drawings to anyone with an internet connection and a screen.
